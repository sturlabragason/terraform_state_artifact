[![Terraform State Artifact](https://github.com/devgioele/terraform-state-artifact/actions/workflows/integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/devgioele/terraform-state-artifact/actions/workflows/integration.yml)

An action that stores your Terraform state file as an encrypted Github workflow artifact and downloads and decrypts the state on subsequent runs.

Be aware that [Github delets artifacts older then 90 days](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-organization-settings/configuring-the-retention-period-for-github-actions-artifacts-and-logs-in-your-organization) by default. You can [run your pipeline on a schedule](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events) to create a new artifact at least once every 90 days.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - name: Download Terraform state
    uses: devgioele/terraform-state-artifact@v4
    with:
      passphrase: ${{ secrets.TF_STATE_PASSPHRASE }}
      download_upload: download
  - name: Setup Terraform
    uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
  - name: Terraform init
    run: terraform init
  - name: Terraform validate
    run: terraform validate
  - name: Terraform apply
    run: terraform apply -auto-approve
  - name: Upload Terraform state
    uses: devgioele/terraform-state-artifact@v4
    with:
      passphrase: ${{ secrets.TF_STATE_PASSPHRASE }}
      download_upload: upload
```

Generate a secure password and store in a GitHub secret named `TF_STATE_PASSPHRASE`.

## Credits

This action would not have been possible without [the previous work done by sturlabragason](https://github.com/sturlabragason/terraform_state_artifact). I created a fork instead of a PR, because I wanted my changes to take immediate effect.
